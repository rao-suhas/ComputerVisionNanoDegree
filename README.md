# ComputerVisionNanoDegree

This repo contains the collection of projects designed and executed during my term with Udacity's Computer vision nano degree program

* **Project1 - Detecting facial keypoints**
  * Facial keypoints define certain landmarks on the face such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. These are usually usefull information in applications such as face detection, emotion recognition, expression recognition, etc.
* **Pytorch Practice**
  * The framework used in the nano degree was pytorch. A hands-on semi-course was provided as a part of it to understand the designing/development of neural net models using pytorch
