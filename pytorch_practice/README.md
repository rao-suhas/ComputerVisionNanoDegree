# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repo contains notebooks and related code for Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lessons. It is offered as an extra lesson in Computer Vision Nano degree program.

* **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
  * Contains creation of tensors, operation on tensors and converison between tensors to numpy and vice versa.
* **Part 2:** Building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
  * Part 2 is a take on building neural net architectures. Mainly focuses on two types:
    * Sequential models
    * Build from scratch
* **Part 3:** How to train a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST
  * Part 3 notebook shows a simple neural net architecture for classification of digits using just the dense layers
* **Part 4:** Exercise - train a neural network on Fashion-MNIST
  * Contains a fully trainable neural network with train and test validations.
* **Part 5:** Using a trained network for making predictions and validating networks
* **Part 6:** How to save and load trained models
* **Part 7:** Load image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
* **Part 8:** Use transfer learning to train a state-of-the-art image classifier for dogs and cats
